The statement is also consistent with section \n11(1)(a) of the Act. \nStrategic Priorities and Financial Policy \nIn this budget, the Government continues its commitment to the principles of responsible \nfinancial management. \nThe financial objectives and the key measures below outline the Government’s financial \npolicy.  Strategic priorities, as they relate to the Territory’s Budget, are summarised as: \n• maintain a balanced budget over the economic cycle; \n• maintain low levels of debt; \n• provide the highest possible standard of government services; \n• service delivery which focuses on people, the environment and building prosperity;  \n• maintain a triple A credit rating; and \n• effective integration of economic and environmental considerations to promote \nsustainability of service delivery. \nThe 2005-06 Budget and Forward Estimates have been prepared taking into account the need \nto provide sustainable social and economic services and infrastructure to the community and \nthe objective of ecologically sustainable development, as required by the Act.  Future \nBudgets will over time, as these principles become more firmly integrated with decision \nmaking processes, demonstrate stronger linkages with these principles.   \nThe Budget is economically sustainable.  The Budget provides an aggregate surplus over four \nyears.  Short and long-term financial indicators are sound.  Cash reserves are reducing \nthrough to 2006-07 but are forecast to grow in 2008-09, and notably, general government \nborrowings have not increased.   \nThe Budget is socially responsible.  Considerable resources are directed into key service \ndelivery areas, such as health, education, child and family support.  In many cases, these \nresources are dedicated to meeting the increasing demand of a growing and ageing \npopulation; for example, hospital waiting lists, dental services, and provision of traineeships \nand apprenticeships to meet skill shortages.  In other cases, resources are targeted at those \nmost vulnerable and in need; for example, provision for children with disability, family \nviolence intervention and complex needs, child protection, and pensioner concessions.   \n2005-06 Budget Paper No. 3 \n5 \nFinancial Policy Objectives and Strategies Statement",

A four-year planning horizon recognises that it is not always \nnecessary to deliver surpluses every year without any regard to the broader context of the \neconomy and the service and infrastructure requirements of the community.  What is \nimportant is that a surplus is delivered over the economic cycle. \n2005-06 Budget Paper No. 3 \n6 \nFinancial Policy Objectives and Strategies Statement",

These include a major \nnew recreational area at Stromlo Forest Park, a new Primary and Pre-School in East \nGungahlin and a replacement for the Quamby Youth Detention Centre.  Additional funding \nfor continuing projects such as the Gungahlin Drive Extension and the Alexander \nMaconachie Centre (Correctional Facility) has also been included. \nA base level of funding has also been provided for capital upgrades; that is, works which \nincrease service delivery capacity or extend the useful lives of existing assets.  A further \nprovision has been made to finance capital upgrades through a five-year rolling program. \n \n2005-06 Budget Paper No. 3 \n10 \nFinancial Policy Objectives and Strategies Statement",
